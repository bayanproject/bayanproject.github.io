  					Community detection is the descriptive process of clustering the nodes of a network (graph). It is an unsupervised task with a wide range of applications in life sciences (e.g., biological systems), social sciences (offline/online social networks), physical sciences (VLSI design, complex systems), mathematical sciences (agent-based models, computer vision), and even health sciences (drug discovery) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">(Wikipedia). </a>
  					<img src="6meupu.gif" id = "cd-gif"> </img>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					There are several existing methods (algorithms) for approaching this computational problem. One family of algorithms attempts to find communities by maximizing <em>modularity</em>: a network-level quantity indicating the fraction of intra-community edges minus the expected fraction under a degree-preserving null model.

  				In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14698">first part of this project</a>, we solved the following exact Integer Programming (IP) model for a testbed of 80 real networks and random graphs. We evaluated eight existing modularity-based community detection methods, <em> <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.greedy_modularity.html">CNM (Greedy)</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.louvain.html">Louvain</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.pycombo.html">Combo</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.belief.html">Belief</a></em>, <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.leiden.html">Leiden</a></em>, <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.paris.html">Paris</a></em>, <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.edmot.html">EdMot</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.rb_pots.html">Leicht Newman (LN)</a></em>.<br>

				Notation for the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15427951.2014.950875"> IP model</a>: The input is graph G=(V,E) with |V|=n nodes, |E|=m edges, and adjacency matrix entries a_{ij}. d_i is the degree of node i, gamma is the resolution parameter. The term associated with each pair (i,j) is b_{ij} and referred to as the modularity matrix entry for (i,j). Using the binary decision variable x_{ij} for each pair of distinct nodes (i,j), their cluster membership is either the same (represented by x_{ij}=0) or different (represented by x_{ij}=1). K(i,j) indicates a minimum-cardinality separating set for the nodes i,j. Accordingly, the problem of maximizing the modularity of input graph G can be formulated as the IP model above <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15427951.2014.950875">(Dinh and Thai 2015)</a>.

  			<li>
  				We investigated the extent to which current heuristic modularity maximization algorithms succeed in maximizing modularity by evaluating <br>(1) the ratio of their output modularity to the maximum modularity for a given graph (GOP) and <br>(2) the similarity between their output partition and all modularity-maximizing partitions of that graph using Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI).<br> The following figure shows scatterplots of GOP on the y-axis and AMI on the x-axis for the combination of each network and algorithm.<br>
  			</li>

  				<img src="scatter.png"
				width="650">
  				<br>
				<li>
  				Looking at the y-axis values in the figure, we observe that there is a substantial variation in the values of GOP (i.e., extent of sub-optimality) returned by the eight heuristic algorithms. The x-axis values in the figure show the considerable dissimilarity between the sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partition for these networks. Focusing on the position of data points, we observe that they are mostly located above their corresponding 45-degree line. This indicates that sub-optimal partitions tend to be disproportionally dissimilar to any optimal partition. This result goes against the naive viewpoint that close-to-maximum modularity partitions are also close to an optimal partition.
  			<li>
					The average modularity-based heuristic algorithm returns optimal partitions for only 19.4% of these graphs. Taken together with the low success rates of heuristic algorithms in maximizing modularity, our results indicate a crucial mismatch between the design philosophy of modularity maximization algorithms for community detection and their performance: Heuristic modularity maximization algorithms rarely return an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal partition.
			</li>
			<li>
         The Bayan algorithm solves this fundamental problem and provides optimal partitions and partitions within a guaranteed proximity to an optimal partition.

				<li>
					In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04562">second part of this project</a>, we compared Bayan with 29 existing methods for community detection in a testbed of randomly generated LFR benchmark graphs (and ABCD benchmark graphs). Regardless of using modularity or other approaches, community detection methods can be compared based on their capability in retrieving the ground-truth communities of LFR benchmark graphs using AMI. We generate LFR graphs with different values for the mixing parameter mu (fraction of inter-community edges). Increasing mu increases the disassociation of the structure and ground-truth communities.
				</li>
				<li>
					We evaluated the AMI between the ground-truth planted partitions and the partitions returned from each algorithm,

					The figure above ranks the 30 algorithms based on AMI in five experiment settings (each with a specific mu parameter value) averaged over 100 LFR graphs.
  			</li>
				<li>
					Bayan has a relatively high and stable performance rank over different values of the mu parameter. This indicates the distinctive capability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving the ground-truth communities. These descriptive results are confirmed by rigorous statistical tests on the performance of these algorithms (read the Bayan preprint for more info).
