  			Aim

  		<p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>
  					To develop a new reliable, open-source, and reproducible algorithm for a robust and theoretically grounded detection of communities, with optimal guarantees.

  					The process of inductively identifying groups within a network (graph), is a core problem in data science <a href="">(link) </a>

  				<li>
  					There are several existing methods and algorithms for approaching this computational problem. One family of algorithms attempts to find communities by maximizing modularity.

  			Modularity Maximization

  			<li>
  				Modularity: A network-level quantity indicating the fitness of inferred communities in being internally cohesive and mutually separated. <a href="">(link)</a>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				Despite their name and design philosophy, current modularity maximization algorithms fail to maximize modularity or guarantee proximity to a globally optimal solution. They result in degenerate solutions of communities that are likely to be far from the intended modular structure with maximum likelihood based on a degree-preserving null model

  		<ul>
  			<li>
  				In the first step of this project, we used an exact integer programming model alongside existing heuristic methods for maximizing modularity in small real social networks and random networks
  			</li>
  			<img src="ip_formulation.png">
  			<li>
  				We evaluated the gap in modularity between the integer programming solution and four heuristics, <a href="">CNM</a>, <a href="">Louvain</a>, <a href="">Combo</a> and <a href="">Leiden</a>
  				<img src="modularity_gap_4_heuristics.png">
  				<br>
  				The optimality gap for Belief and NMF were larger than X% and hence have been ommitted from this plot.
  				<br>
  				The best performing algorithm, Combo has an optimality gap of X% 
  				<br></br>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				We also measured the level of similarity between sub-optimal and optimal communities using the concept of normalized mutual information (NMI) which takes the value 1 if the communities match. 
  				<img src="nmi_4_heuristics.png">

  				<!-- While Combo performs well on this test set, it is not optimal nor does it provide an approximate guarantee. -->
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				It is clear that there is a gap between the currently available best methods and the optimal solution. Additionally, the memory and time requirements for the IP make it an impractical solution for large networks. Hence, we are working on the Bayan Algorithm, combining ideas from integer programming (the branch-and-cut algorithm) with efficient heuristic methods to exactly solve this fundamental problem for small and mid-size networks and provide solutions with approximation guarantees for large networks.
