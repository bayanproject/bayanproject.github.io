  					Community detection is the process of inductively identifying groups within a network (graph). It is a core problem in data science with a wide range of applications in life sciences (e.g., biological systems), social sciences (social networks), physical sciences (complex systems), mathematical sciences (informational networks), and even health sciences (drug discovery) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">(Wikipedia). </a>
  					<img src="6meupu.gif" id = "cd-gif"> </img>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					There are several existing methods and algorithms for approaching this computational problem. One family of algorithms attempts to find communities by maximizing <em>modularity</em>: A network-level quantity indicating the fitness of inferred communities in being internally cohesive and mutually separated.

  	<div id="curr-work-div">
  		<ul>
  			<li>
  				In the first step of this project, we used the following exact integer programming model alongside existing heuristic methods for maximizing modularity in a testbed of real social networks and random networks.
  			</li>
  			<img src="ip_formulation.png">
  			<li>
  				We evaluated the gap in modularity between the integer programming globally optimal solution and several existing modularity-based community detection methods, <em> <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.greedy_modularity.html">CNM (Greedy)</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.louvain.html">Louvain</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.pycombo.html">Combo</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.belief.html">Belief</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.leiden.html">Leiden</a></em>.<br>
  				<img src="modularity_gap_4_heuristics.png">
  				<br>
  				The optimality gap for the Belief algorithm was consistently larger than 20% and hence it has been omitted from the plot. According to this evaluation, the best performing heuristic algorithm for maximizing modularity, in terms of proximity to an optimal solution, is Combo (Sobolevsky et al. 2014) which is the only heuristic with an optimality gap lower than 5% for both real and synthetic networks in our experiments. Note that the optimality gap of modularity maximization heuristics often remains unknown in the absence of an exact or approximation algorithm.
  				<br></br>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				We also measured the level of similarity between the sub-optimal communities from each heuristic method and the optimal modularity-maximizing communities using the concept of normalized <em>Adjusted Mutual Information</em> (AMI). AMI represents the degree of the match between a pair of network partitions accounting for similarity by chance (e.g., AMI takes the value 1 for two identical partitions).<br>
  				<img src="nmi_4_heuristics.png">

  				<!-- While Combo performs well on this test set, it is not optimal nor does it provide an approximate guarantee. -->
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				This simple analysis indicates that there could be substantial dissimilarity between the partitions obtained from the current heuristic methods and a modularity-maximizing partition even if the optimality of the heuristic is low. Bayan algorithm solves this fundamental problem and provides partitions within a guaranteed proximity of the maximum modularity.

					<li>
					Regardless of using modularity or other approaches, community detection methods can be compared based on their capability in retrieving the ground-truth communities planted in LFR graphs using AMI. The figure above ranks the algorithms based on AMI in seven experiment settings (seven values of the LFR mu parameter) averaged over 100 LFR graphs.
  			</li>
				<li>
					Bayan has a relatively stable performance rank over all values of the mu parameter (fraction of inter-community edges used in generating LFR graphs). Also, averaging the AMIs over all 700 LFR graphs, Bayan has the largest average AMI. This indicates the capability of Bayan in retrieving the ground-truth communities.
				</li>
				<li>
 				The Bayan algorithm will soon be publicly available as a part of the <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/"> Community Discovery Library (CDlib) </a> for Python alongside a wrapper for R users.
