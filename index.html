  			Community Detection
  		</h2>
  		<ul id="cd-ul">
  				<li>
  					Community detection is the process of inductively identifying groups within a network (graph). It is a core problem in data science with a wide range of applications in life sciences (e.g. biological systems), social sciences (social networks), physicial sciences (complex systems), mathematical sciences (informational networks), and even health sciences (drug discovery) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure">(Wikipedia). </a>
  					<img src="6meupu.gif" id = "cd-gif"> </img>
  				</li>
  				<li>
  					There are several existing methods and algorithms for approaching this computational problem. One family of algorithms attempts to find communities by maximizing <em>modularity</em>: A network-level quantity indicating the fitness of inferred communities in being internally cohesive and mutually separated.

  	<h1 id="curr-work">Do we need yet another community detection algorithm? Yes, and here's why:</h1>

  	<div id="curr-work-div">
  		<ul>
  			<li>
  				In the first step of this project, we used the following exact integer programming model alongside existing heuristic methods for maximizing modularity in a testbed of real social networks and random networks.
  			</li>
  			<img src="ip_formulation.png">
  			<li>
  				We evaluated the gap in modularity between the integer programming globally optimal solution and several existing modularity-based community detection methods, <em> <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.greedy_modularity.html">CNM</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.louvain.html">Louvain</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.pycombo.html">Combo</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.belief.html">Belief</a>, <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.mnmf.html">non-negative matrix factorization</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/cd_algorithms/algs/cdlib.algorithms.leiden.html">Leiden</a></em>.<br>
  				<img src="modularity_gap_4_heuristics.png">
  				<br>
  				The optimality gap for the two algorithms Belief and non-negative matrix factorization were consistently larger than 20% and hence they have been ommitted from this plot.	According to this evaluation, the best performing heuristic algorithm, in terms of proximity to an optimal solution, is Combo (Sobolevsky et al. 2014) which is the only heuristic with an optimality gap lower than 5% for both real and synthetic networks in our experiments.
  				<br></br>
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				We also measured the level of similarity between the sub-optimal communities from each heuristic method and the optimal modularity-maximizing communities using the concept of <em>normalized mutual information</em> (NMI). NMI represents the degree of the match between a pair of network partitions on a scale of 0 to 1 (e.g. NMI takes the value 1 for two identical partitions).<br>
  				<img src="nmi_4_heuristics.png">

  				<!-- While Combo performs well on this test set, it is not optimal nor does it provide an approximate guarantee. -->
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				This simple analysis indicates a susbtantial gap (1-NMI) between the partitions obtained using the current heuristic methods and a true modularity-maximizing partition of those networks.
  			</li>
  			<li>
  				Bayan algorithm solves this fundamental problem and provides partitions within a guaranteed proximity of the maximum modularity. The Bayan algorithm will soon be publicly available as a part of the <a href="https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/"> Community Discovery Library (CDlib) </a> for Python alongside a wrapper for R users.
